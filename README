Notes:

* The code in master doesn't actually build for the MSP430G2231 target, since
  its larger than the 2kb. I didn't want to put the stripped down version in
  master, thus you can find it in the 'stripped'-branch.

* Porting the code to other microcontrollers should be possible quite easily,
  since despite from the interrupt/timer/SPI functions there's no other
  dependency on the MSP430 peripherals.
  Please note the comments at the end of /src/segments.h for this purpose.
